# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz


Goal Number 1 
Control the presentaiton of questions on the screen
    So we want to show questions when the user clicks on something
    We are going to look at addEventListener
When the user enters an answer we need to check to see if it is right then we need to show the correct answer (validation)
    We will create a p element that says Correct or Wrong to validate answer
    We will wait 2 seconds (so user can see validation) before moving to the next question
If the user gets it wrong we need to subtract from the timer
    We need to get a running count of the timer 
    We need to subtract by 1 second 
    When the answer is wrong the timer will subtract by 4 seconds


Goal 2
    We need to build a timer that counts down at a certain interval
